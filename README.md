# FriendFinder-app

This app is a compatibility based "FriendFinder" application, similar to a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from the users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

  * The page opens up on the homepage, where the user can then be directed to the survey.

  * The survey has 10 questions, and each answer is based on a scale of 1 to 5 depending on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

-------------------

  * This app was built with html, css, javascript, jQuery, node, express, and other npm packages: path, and body-parser.

It can be run on a node server, or found at:
